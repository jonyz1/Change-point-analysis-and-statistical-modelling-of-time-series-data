Task 1 Report: Laying the Foundation for Brent Oil Price Analysis
1. Introduction
This report outlines the initial steps for analyzing the impact of major events on Brent oil prices from 2012 to 2022. Task 1 focuses on data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), event data compilation, and defining the analysis workflow. The provided Jupyter notebook performs data loading, cleaning, visualization, and stationarity testing, while the event dataset lists key geopolitical, economic, and OPEC-related events. This report integrates these components to establish a foundation for Task 2, which will involve Bayesian Change Point modeling to detect structural breaks and correlate them with events.
2. Data Analysis Workflow
The workflow for analyzing Brent oil prices and their relationship with major events is as follows:

Data Loading and Cleaning:

Load the Brent oil price dataset (BrentOilPrices.csv) using pandas.
Convert the Date column to datetime format, handling inconsistencies with errors='coerce'.
Sort data chronologically and set Date as the index.
Check for missing values, duplicates, and non-numeric entries in the Price column; address issues via interpolation or removal.
Compute log returns (log(price_t / price_{t-1})) to stabilize variance and facilitate stationarity analysis.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the price series to identify trends, shocks, and volatility clusters.
Plot log returns to assess volatility patterns.
Conduct statistical tests (e.g., Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) to evaluate stationarity.
Summarize descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance) for prices and log returns.


Event Data Compilation:

Compile a dataset of 10-15 major events (2012–2022) impacting oil prices, with columns: Event_Date, Event_Description, Event_Type, and Source.
Align event dates with the price dataset for correlation analysis.


Change Point Modeling (Planned for Task 2):

Implement a Bayesian Change Point model using PyMC3 to detect structural breaks in the price or log return series.
Estimate posterior distributions for switch points (tau) and parameters (e.g., mean price before/after breaks).


Event-Change Point Association (Planned for Task 2):

Align detected change points with event dates to hypothesize causal relationships.
Quantify price impacts (e.g., percentage change post-event).


Visualization and Reporting:

Develop an interactive dashboard using Flask (backend) and React with Recharts (frontend) to visualize price trends, log returns, change points, and event markers.
Summarize findings in a report or blog post for stakeholders (investors, policymakers, energy companies).


Validation:

Validate model results using convergence diagnostics (e.g., r_hat, trace plots).
Assess sensitivity to data transformations and prior assumptions.



3. Data Preparation and Cleaning
The Jupyter notebook loads the Brent oil price dataset (BrentOilPrices.csv) from Google Drive and performs initial cleaning:

Date Conversion: The Date column is converted to datetime using pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], errors='coerce'). The errors='coerce' parameter handles inconsistent date formats (e.g., "20-May-87" vs. "Apr 22, 2020"), setting invalid entries to NaT.
Sorting and Indexing: The data is sorted by date and set as the index for time-series analysis.
Missing Values: The notebook checks for missing values using df.isnull().sum(). Any NaT dates or missing Price values will be addressed by dropping or interpolating in subsequent steps.
Log Returns: Log returns are computed as np.log(df['Price'] / df['Price'].shift(1)) to stabilize variance and prepare for stationarity analysis.

Descriptive Statistics
The notebook’s df.describe() output provides insights into the Price column:

Count: Number of valid price entries.
Mean, Std, Min, Max: Indicate the central tendency, volatility, and range of prices.
Quartiles: Show the distribution of prices (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%).

If missing values or outliers are detected, further cleaning (e.g., interpolation for small gaps, removal of extreme outliers) will be applied in Task 2.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Price Series Visualization
The notebook plots the Brent oil price series using Matplotlib:

Observation: The plot (plt.plot(df['Price'])) shows long-term trends, with notable peaks (e.g., ~2012–2014, ~2022) and troughs (e.g., ~2016, ~2020). Sharp price drops (e.g., 2020) and spikes (e.g., 2022) suggest external shocks.
Implication: These patterns indicate non-stationarity and potential structural breaks, which the Bayesian Change Point model will detect.

Stationarity Test
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is applied to the price series:

ADF Statistic: result[0] (negative values indicate stronger evidence against non-stationarity).
p-value: result[1] (p < 0.05 rejects the null hypothesis of non-stationarity).
Interpretation: A high p-value (e.g., > 0.05) suggests the price series is non-stationary, as expected for commodity prices. Log returns are computed to achieve approximate stationarity, confirmed by visualizing df['Log_Returns'].

Log Returns Visualization
The notebook plots log returns:

Observation: The plot (plt.plot(df['Log_Returns'])) shows volatility clustering, with periods of high volatility (e.g., 2020 COVID-19 crash, 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict) and calmer periods. Log returns fluctuate around zero, indicating approximate stationarity.
Implication: Log returns are suitable for modeling volatility changes and detecting structural breaks in the Bayesian model.

5. Event Data Compilation
The event dataset is filtered to include only events from 2012–2022, as per the project’s focus. Below is the structured dataset, incorporating the provided events and adding sources for verification. Events outside 2012–2022 (e.g., 2008 Financial Crisis, 2010 Arab Spring, 2011 Libya Civil War) are excluded.

Event Selection Rationale

Coverage: The dataset includes 9 events, balancing Conflict (2), Economic (3), OPEC Policy (2), Sanctions (1), and Health (1) to capture diverse market drivers.
Relevance: Events were selected for their documented impact on oil supply (e.g., Saudi Aramco attack), demand (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), or market sentiment (e.g., Iran sanctions).
Sources: Credible sources (Reuters, BBC, WHO, EIA) ensure reliability and verifiability.
Alignment: Event dates are formatted as YYYY-MM-DD to align with the price dataset’s datetime index.

6. Assumptions and Limitations
Assumptions

Brent oil prices reflect global oil market dynamics.
Major events (e.g., OPEC decisions, conflicts) are primary drivers of significant price changes.
Log returns approximate stationarity, making them suitable for change point modeling.
Detected change points align temporally with external events.

Limitations

Correlation vs. Causation: Change points near events do not confirm causation; other factors (e.g., demand shifts, speculation) may contribute.
Event Completeness: The dataset may miss minor events or precise event dates, limiting causal attribution.
Data Quality: Inconsistent date formats or missing trading days in BrentOilPrices.csv could affect accuracy.
Model Simplification: The Bayesian model assumes discrete change points, potentially missing gradual shifts.

7. Planned Next Steps (Task 2)

Modeling: Implement the Bayesian Change Point model using PyMC3 to detect structural breaks in log returns or prices. Estimate switch points (tau) and parameters (e.g., mean, variance) with MCMC sampling.
Event Correlation: Align change points with event dates to hypothesize relationships. Quantify impacts (e.g., percentage price change post-event).
Dashboard Development: Build a Flask/React dashboard to visualize price trends, log returns, change points, and event markers, with filters for date ranges and event types.
Reporting: Summarize findings in a blog post or PDF, targeting investors, policymakers, and energy companies.

8. Communication Channels

Interactive Dashboard: A Flask backend and React frontend with Recharts for visualizing price trends, log returns, and event impacts. Users can filter by date or event type and download reports.
Written Report: A blog post (e.g., on Medium) or PDF summarizing methodology, EDA results, change points, and event associations.
GitHub Repository: Host code, datasets, and documentation at [GitHub link] (to be created by 01 Aug 2025) for transparency and reproducibility.

9. Conclusion
Task 1 establishes a robust foundation for analyzing Brent oil price dynamics. The notebook’s data cleaning and EDA confirm non-stationarity in prices, volatility clustering in log returns, and the need for change point modeling. The compiled event dataset provides a diverse set of market drivers for correlation analysis. Task 2 will build on this by implementing the Bayesian model and developing an interactive dashboard to communicate findings effectively.
